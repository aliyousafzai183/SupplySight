🏗️ Take-Home Frontend Challenge — 
SupplySight Dashboard
Hi! 👋 Thanks for interviewing with us.
Here’s a small but tricky challenge that should take around 4 hours. It’s designed to mimic the kind of work you’d do here: turning specs into a polished frontend, wiring APIs, and applying business logic.
________________


🎯 The Task
Build a Daily Inventory Dashboard for a supply chain platform called SupplySight.
Your mission:
* Set up your own React + Tailwind project.

* Create a small mock GraphQL server (Apollo, urql, or anything you like).

* Implement the dashboard UI as per the spec below.

📊 GraphQL Schema (use this to seed a mock API)
  

Sample Data 👍
[
  { "id": "P-1001", "name": "12mm Hex Bolt", "sku": "HEX-12-100", "warehouse": "BLR-A", "stock": 180, "demand": 120 },
  { "id": "P-1002", "name": "Steel Washer", "sku": "WSR-08-500", "warehouse": "BLR-A", "stock": 50, "demand": 80 },
  { "id": "P-1003", "name": "M8 Nut", "sku": "NUT-08-200", "warehouse": "PNQ-C", "stock": 80, "demand": 80 },
  { "id": "P-1004", "name": "Bearing 608ZZ", "sku": "BRG-608-50", "warehouse": "DEL-B", "stock": 24, "demand": 120 }
]








🖥️ What to Build
   1. Dashboard Layout

      * Top bar with logo text SupplySight + date range chips (7d / 14d / 30d).

      * KPI cards:

         * Total Stock (sum of stock)

         * Total Demand (sum of demand)

         * Fill Rate = (sum(min(stock, demand)) / sum(demand)) * 100%

            * Line chart: Stock vs Demand trend (from kpis(range)).

            * Filters row:

               * Search box (by name, SKU, ID)

               * Warehouse dropdown (from warehouses)

               * Status dropdown (All / Healthy / Low / Critical)

                  2. Products Table

                     * Columns: Product, SKU, Warehouse, Stock, Demand, Status.

                     * Status pill rules:

                        * 🟢 Healthy = stock > demand

                        * 🟡 Low = stock = demand

                        * 🔴 Critical = stock < demand (entire row lightly red-tinted)

                           * Pagination: 10 rows/page.

                              3. Interactions

                                 * Filters update results live.

                                 * Clicking a row opens a right-side drawer with:

                                    * Product details

                                    * Update Demand form (mutation)

                                    * Transfer Stock form (mutation)



📦 Deliverable
                                       * A GitHub repo (or zip) with your code.

                                       * A short NOTES.md describing decisions, trade-offs, and what you’d improve with more time.



✅ What We Look For
                                          * Clean React + Tailwind code structure

                                          * Correct data wiring (queries, filters, mutations)

                                          * Handling of loading/error states

                                          * Business logic correctness (Healthy/Low/Critical)

                                          * Attention to detail in UX



That’s it! 🚀
Think of it as your chance to show us how you’d build a real feature — not just code, but also how you balance speed, clarity, and usability.
