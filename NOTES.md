# SupplySight Dashboard - Technical Notes

## Architecture Decisions & Tradeoffs

### Monorepo Structure
**Decision**: Used npm workspaces with `apps/web` and `apps/server` separation
**Rationale**: 
- Keeps UI and API concerns separate while sharing tooling
- Enables independent deployment of frontend and backend
- Matches the assignment requirement for both React app and GraphQL server
- Easier dependency management and versioning

**Alternative Considered**: Single app with embedded GraphQL server
**Tradeoff**: Would simplify setup but violates separation of concerns

### Frontend Framework Choices

#### React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
**Decision**: Modern React with TypeScript and Vite
**Rationale**:
- TypeScript provides compile-time safety for complex business logic
- Vite offers faster development experience than Create React App
- React 18 features (concurrent rendering, automatic batching) for future scalability

#### TanStack Router vs React Router
**Decision**: TanStack Router for type-safe routing
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe route definitions and parameters
- Better integration with TypeScript
- URL-driven state management for filters
**Tradeoff**: Smaller ecosystem compared to React Router

#### Apollo Client vs urql
**Decision**: Apollo Client for GraphQL operations
**Rationale**:
- Mature ecosystem with excellent TypeScript support
- Normalized cache for optimistic updates
- Built-in error handling and loading states
- Better developer tools

### Backend Framework Choices

#### GraphQL Yoga vs Apollo Server
**Decision**: GraphQL Yoga for the mock API
**Rationale**:
- Lighter weight for a mock server
- Modern GraphQL-first approach
- Easy to extend and modify
- Built-in playground for testing

#### Pino vs Winston
**Decision**: Pino for structured logging
**Rationale**:
- Better performance for high-throughput scenarios
- JSON-structured logs for better observability
- Smaller bundle size

### UI/UX Decisions

#### Tailwind CSS vs Styled Components
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS for styling
**Rationale**:
- Rapid development with utility classes
- Consistent design system out of the box
- Smaller bundle size in production
- Matches assignment requirement

#### Recharts vs D3.js
**Decision**: Recharts for data visualization
**Rationale**:
- React-native API
- Built-in responsiveness
- Good TypeScript support
- Faster development than D3.js

## Business Logic Implementation

### Status Calculation
```typescript
const getStatus = (stock: number, demand: number): Status => {
  if (stock > demand) return 'HEALTHY';
  if (stock === demand) return 'LOW';
  return 'CRITICAL';
};
```
**Decision**: Simple, readable logic matching assignment requirements exactly
**Tradeoff**: Could be more sophisticated with thresholds and ranges

### Fill Rate Calculation
```typescript
const fillRate = totalDemand > 0 
  ? products.reduce((sum, p) => sum + Math.min(p.stock, p.demand), 0) / totalDemand * 100
  : 0;
```
**Decision**: Matches assignment specification exactly
**Rationale**: Clear business logic that's easy to understand and test

### Filtering Strategy
**Decision**: Client-side filtering with debounced search
**Rationale**:
- Immediate UI feedback
- Reduces server load
- Better user experience
**Tradeoff**: Could be server-side for large datasets

## Data Layer Architecture

### GraphQL Schema Design
**Decision**: Simple, focused schema matching assignment requirements
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to extend
- Matches the provided sample data structure

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Apollo Client normalized cache
**Rationale**:
- Automatic cache updates across components
- Optimistic updates for mutations
- Reduces unnecessary network requests

### Error Handling
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
**Rationale**:
- Better user experience
- Helps with debugging
- Production-ready error boundaries

## Performance Considerations

### Code Splitting
**Decision**: Route-level code splitting with Vite
**Rationale**:
- Faster initial page load
- Better caching strategies
- Progressive loading

### Optimistic Updates
**Decision**: Implemented for mutations
**Rationale**:
- Snappy user experience
- Immediate feedback
- Automatic rollback on errors

### Memoization
**Decision**: Used React.memo and useMemo where beneficial
**Rationale**:

- Better performance for expensive calculations
- Careful not to over-optimize

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
**Decision**: Vitest + React Testing Library
**Rationale**:
- Fast execution
- Good React component testing
- TypeScript support

### E2E Testing
**Decision**: Playwright for end-to-end testing
**Rationale**:
- Cross-browser testing
- Modern async/await API
- Good debugging tools

### Test Coverage
**Decision**: Focus on business logic and user interactions
**Rationale**:
- Tests that provide value
- Coverage of critical paths
- Maintainable test suite

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
**Decision**: Zod schemas for runtime validation
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe validation
- Good error messages
- Easy to maintain

### CORS Configuration
**Decision**: Environment-specific CORS settings
**Rationale**:
- Secure in production
- Flexible for development
- Prevents unauthorized access

### GraphQL Security
**Decision**: Basic introspection control
**Rationale**:
- Prevents schema exposure in production
- Maintains development experience
- Simple to implement

## Recent Improvements (Post-Initial Implementation)

### ✅ Pagination Implementation
**Added**: Server-side pagination with ProductConnection type
**Features**:
- Page-based navigation with Previous/Next buttons
- Page number display with ellipsis for large page counts
- URL state persistence for current page
- Automatic page reset when filters change

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
type ProductConnection {
  products: [Product!]!
  totalCount: Int!
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  currentPage: Int!
  totalPages: Int!
}
```
